@interface UIAlertView (Block) <UIAlertViewDelegate>

/**
 * Initialize a UIAlertView with a completion block to avoid the need to conform to the `UIAlertViewDelegate` protocol
 * and implementing `alertView:clickedButtonAtIndex:`.
 *
 * The completion block is always called on the main thread.
 * 
 * @param title The string that appears in the receiverâ€™s title bar.
 * @param message Descriptive text that provides more details than the title.
 * @param block The completion block to be called when the `UIAlertView` is dismissed with a button tap.
 * @param cancelButtonTitle The title of the cancel button or nil if there is no cancel button. Using this argument is
 * equivalent to setting the cancel button index to the value returned by invoking `addButtonWithTitle:` specifying this
 * title.
 * @param otherButtonTitles The title of another button. Using this argument is equivalent to invoking
 * `addButtonWithTitle:` with this title to add more buttons. Too many buttons can cause the alert view to scroll. For
 * guidelines on the best ways to use an alert in an app, see Temporary Views.
 * @param ... Titles of additional buttons to add to the receiver, terminated with `nil`.
 *
 * @return Newly initialized alert view.
